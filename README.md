## Functional and Secure
I ensure my code is functional and secure by using tests to show that the the code is functional and secure. Unit tests are a great way to validate your work as a set of parts as opposed to just testing the final solution. I don't necessarily agree with test driven development, however I do think that it is important to build and perform tests alongside development to ensure quality.

## Interpret user needs
The best way to do this is to build the code in a way that adheres to the requirements. There's an entire discussion about ensuring that the requirements that the design team is handed is in fact what the client actually wants. Once the design team has the requirements, it is important that the design team builds a system that performs the requirements. It's important to also include tests that can show the client that the system does what it is expected to do.

## Approach
It really begins with requirements. The desgin team needs specific requriements or else the solution is not going to be specific to what the client wants. This may be hard for stakeholders to be decisive here but it is a crucial first step. We discussed building above. Oncve the system has been released and deployed, the development team should begin monitoring the system and assessing the effectiveness of the solution and recording ways to possibly improve. Frequent conversations should take place with stakeholders to ensure that the system is in fact doing its job. If not, the development team should take steps to course correct.
